    "You might have seen artists creating pictures from hundreds or even thousands of Rubik's cubes. The main challenge of this art is converting a full-color photo into a 6-color pixelized version. This tool automates the entire process for you.",
    "<h3 class='mt-4'>Video tutorial</h3>",
    "<div class='text-center' id='videoTutorialWrap'></div>",
    "<h3 class='mt-4'>Does it work with black stickers?</h3>",
"Yes. Click the menu button in the top-right corner of the page, go to palette editor and enable black color. You can change colors as you wish.",
    "<h3 class='mt-4'>I prefer to make mosaic pictures myself. Can I use this website just to split it into sections?</h3>",
    "Yes. If you have your miniature picture ready (e.g. 60x90 pixel image to make 20x30 cubes mosaic), simply rename it to 'miniature.png' and drag-and-drop the file here as you would with normal pictures. The program will skip all adjustments and directly take you to the \"Download PDF\" stage.",
    "<h3 class='mt-4'>Why some images produce much better mosaics than others?</h3>",
    "The quality of the source picture is important. A low-contrast photo taken in poor lighting conditions won't work. Beautifiers will also render the photo unsuitable, as they flatten some facial regions in a way that important facial feature information is lost. However, <b>grayscale pictures are fine</b>. It's definitely worth experimenting with source images to find the ones that work best.",
    "<h3 class='mt-4'>How does it even work?</h3>",
    "Great question! Check the <a href='https://github.com/Roman-/mosaic' target='_blank'>Github repository</a> for the explanation.",
